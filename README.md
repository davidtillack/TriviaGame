# TriviaGame

<!--

If you've found this page, you're looking at a TriviaGame I worked on. This game was created with HTML, CSS, Javacript and JQuery. 
If you play it, you'll discover some issues but overall, the game works as it is supposed to. The user goes through as many questions
as he or she can within a time-limit and then is presented with their score.
